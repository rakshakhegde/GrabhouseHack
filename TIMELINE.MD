Planning to create an app where the user/seeker gets notified about the new flats/rooms, features, price drops, etc.

To trigger realtime push notifs in parse when data changes:

Spoke to Grabhousers, initial idea is too simple.
Now let's make an app where the user is presented with flats in his location of interest. He can favourite listings and they appear in another tab (Shortlist tab) using which he can figure out a way to travel to all these destinations in shortest time possible.
